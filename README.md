# ADS_Cinema_Seating_Planning
group project for the Algorithms for Desicion Support course

online cinema layout designer: https://github.com/yasminvandijk/Cinema_Designer

## implemented algorithms:
### offline / exact:
- first fit - small groups first
- first fit - big groups first
- best fit - small groups first
- best fit - big groups first
- branch and bound

### online:
- first fit
- best fit

### to run the algorithms:
the algorithms are written in C# (.NET Core) and can be found in the C#\_Algorithms folder
1. open the ADS\_CinemaSeating.sln solution in Visual Studio
1. choose the algorithm you want to run by setting the project as startup project:
    - in the solution explorer right-click the name of the project
    - click *Set as Startup Project*
